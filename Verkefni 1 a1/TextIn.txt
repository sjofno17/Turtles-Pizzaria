Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to overcome Kenya's divisions after being sworn in for a second term as president, 
at a ceremony boycotted by the opposition.
Speaking after his inauguration in the capital Nairobi, 
he said he would try to incorporate some of the opposition's ideas "in the spirit of inclusivity".
But elsewhere in the city, police clashed with opposition supporters.
Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who boycotted an election re-run last month, mocked Tuesday's "coronation".
Mr Kenyatta was officially re-elected with 98% of the vote on 26 October but just under 39% of voters turned out.
The original election on 8 August was held again after being annulled by the Supreme Court on grounds of irregularities.
Kenya's 'digital president'
Raila Odinga - Love him or loathe him
What did Kenyatta say exactly?
Embarking on his second and last term in office, he promised to act as "the custodian of the dreams of all" Kenyans.
Without specifying whether he would reach out to Mr Odinga, 
he said: "We may have chosen different candidates and different visions, 
but each one of us voted for a better life.
"To my competitors, and in the spirit of inclusivity, I will endeavour to incorporate some of their ideas. 
The election was not a contest between a good dream and a bad dream. It was a contest between two competing visions.
"I will devote my time and energy to build bridges, to unite and bring prosperity to all Kenyans."
How did the inauguration unfold?
Spectators inside Nairobi's Kasarani sports stadium were entertained by music and dance performances, 
while the military paraded.
